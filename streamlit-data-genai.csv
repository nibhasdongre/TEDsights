I host a YouTube show called Keeping a Real with Adela.",0.217391304347826,"joy, sadness, anger"," What's up people! First of all, I cannot believe I'm on TED Talk. This is a big deal because right now everybody in my village is watching this. And so of course, my bright prize just went up. My name is Adela Fayeon. I'm from Nigeria. I live in the US. I'm a journalist or a comedian or a satris. Anything you want me to be really. I'm every woman. It's all in me. I host a YouTube show called Keeping a Real with Adela. Now this show is a gentle, respectful and very blunt way of calling out corrupt African leaders. I don't know which party my wife belongs to but she belongs to my kitchen. Oh my god! I need some water. I don't want to flee side. I said I need some water. Mmm. Mmm. See, I basically keep a real with them. Ah! Especially when the mess up, which is a lot of times. If any African official is watching me by the way, I'm not talking about you, sir. I'm talking about your colleagues, yes. I do this because Africa has everything in it to be great. You know, I grew up believing that Africa as a continent is a giant. We've got skills, intellectuals, natural resources, modern, any other continent. That supplies 31% of the world's gold, manganese and uranium, 57% of the world's diamonds, and 13% of the world's oil. We have no reason to depend on aid or borrowing money from China or the world bank. But without good leaders, we're like an eagle that has no idea it could fly, let alone soar. Africa is like a sleeping giant. Not the truth is, I'm trying to work up this giant, and that's why I add the dirty laundry of those in charge of the giant. Politicians, religious leaders, with huge respect of course, because modern anything else, African leaders love to be respected. So I give it to them in doses. On my show, I know for them, ha! I call them my uncles, my aunties, my fathers and the Lord. And then I insult them for insulting our intelligence. And it's because we are tired of their hypocrisy and false promises. For example, the Nigerian president vowed to end medical tourism by fixing our dilapidated hospitals and building us new ones. But what did he do? He spent three months receiving treatment in London in 2017. We were without a president for three months. We were president less for three months, so then it becomes my job to call out the president with respect of course. I say, ha! Mr. President, it's your girl, Adelaide, you know, I do well, ha! You have no shame. I forgot to answer. Sir, you have no shame. And Beryl Long, you have no fear of God. 35,000 Nigerian doctors are presently working in the US, the UK and Canada, doing a amazing thing because in Nigeria, they are not well paid, neither do they have the necessary equipment to do the job of being a doctor. And this is happening in many African countries. We have the capacity to fly. But sadly, a lot of African talent is flying straight out of Africa to other continents. For example, the Nigerian doctor operated on an unborn baby in Texas. Also, this Nigerian doctor discovered the neurological effects of concussion on athletes. And many countries have African athletes winning the gold medal for them. The interesting thing is, we're waiting for God to fix Africa. Like for real, it's not every nuclear war, we're waiting for God's world. I mean, just look at the president of Burundi, his jailing journalist and opposition members. But he declared National Day of Prayer so that people could pray for God to fix the country. And I'm like, shouldn't he be fixing the country? Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, we want God to fix it. Do you see what I have to deal with? I'm telling you, Sanda is getting ready to hit this politician someday. We are better than this. I want our leaders to start taking responsibility and stop putting everything on God. God has given us everything we need. It's right here. Let's use it. But here's the thing, my favorite part of what I do. It's featuring Africans doing amazing work, ordinary people, touching lives. Like this Kenyan woman, Wangari Ma's side, the first African woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for standing up for human rights and planting a million trees. Also, this Zimbabwean woman, Dr. Terai Trent, who was married off at the age of 14 in exchange for a cow. Yet, this woman taught herself to read and write, and she ended up on all-prasio. Ah, father, I want to be on all-prasio someday. Today, this woman has built schools for thousands of children in Zimbabwean. Also, popular British architect David Ajay has designed spectacular buildings around the world. And he's both Ghanaian and Tanzanian. So we know that it has to be the Ghanaian Jolof rice, which he ate, that gave him the inspiration to design. Ah, maybe it's the Nigerian Jolof rice because the Nigerian one is better. Anyway, but that is what gave him the inspiration to become the great man that he is today. And while I have your attention, I have one more thing to say. So please move closer. Okay, that's good. That's good. Don't get too close. That's good. I don't like the way some of you. Portrait Africa. Mm-hmm. Not all of you, just some of you. You especially. First of all, it's not a country. It's a continent. I do not know Paul from Uganda. I don't know Rebecca from Zimbabwe. Nigeria is as far from Zimbabwe as New York is from France. And it's not a bunch of naked people in need of Western charity. You have it all wrong. Lions are not only our streets, okay? And I could go on, but you already know what I'm talking about. So while I try to do my job, trying to wake up the sleeping giant, Africa. So she could take her right foot place on the woods arena. You can do your bit too. Please listen more. Listen to your African friends. Without a preconceived notion of what you think that they're going to say. Read African books. Oh my god. Watch African movies. Or at a very least. Learn some of the names of our 54 beautiful countries. That's right. 54, baby. It's high four. All right, y'all. It's been real and I'm keeping it right up in here. Until next time, I'm gonna see you all later. Peace out. You","TED Talk: Keeping a Real with Adela, Adela Fayeon, and Adela Fifeon are all in me. I'm a journalist or a comedian or satris.

By my calculations, Americans order over 20 million restaurant deliveries every single day. Over half of these deliveries are actually within walking distance, but 9 out of 10 are delivered in cars. So basically, we are moving a 2 pound burrito in a 2 ton car 20 million times a day. The energy to bring you that burrito is actually bringing you a 2 ton metal cage with heated seats. Let's be honest, we are addicted to our cars. Did you know that in America, for every car, there are 4 parking spots. In some downtown, over half of the real estate is for cars. We have designed our cities around our cars, because we drive, whether we are going 2 miles or 200 miles, solo or with our whole family. We get into the same SUV to go by coffee or coffee table. If we could free up some of these streets and parking lots, we could build more housing, more social spaces, more parks. But to do that, first, we need to rethink how we are using cars today. In the city of the future, if you want to go 5 blocks, use some on a bike or a scooter. If you are in a rush, a passenger around would pick you up. And if you need food, no need to have someone drive over. The food will make its way to you. Let's go back to those 20 million a day restaurant deliveries. If we could get these deliveries after road, we could reduce the need for as many as 1.5 million cars just in the US. Let's twice the size of San Francisco. Now think of the impact this could have on cities like Delhi or my bare city of Tehran, where car pollution is killing thousands of people every year. So how do we get some of these deliveries after road? Well, that's a question that might have been obsessed with over the last 3 years. The solution is actually one of the building blocks of the city of the future. We've been creating small, self-driving robots that navigate quiet alleys and sidewalk on a watching pace and have a secured cargo to deliver your food and supplies. Now, if I tell you more about the robots, let's do a quick thought experiment. In your mind, picture a city with thousands of robots. Is it this one? This Hollywood dystopia is what a lot of people expect, but our job is to create a friendly future that's designed for people. So instead of making aliens, we set out to create robots that are familiar, robots that would belong in our communities. But we also wanted a little surprise, something unexpectedly delightful. Think about it, you're walking down the street and you see your very first robot. That's a moment when you're going to decide if this is a future you love or fear. And with a lot of people having these dystopian ideas, we need to open their minds. We want to surprise and delight them so that we can win them over on first impression. This is what we came up with. It's familiar, but it's also surprising. It's just a shopping cart, but it also looks like we cross-bred volley with minions. If you live in San Francisco or Los Angeles, chances are one of this has already delivered your food. As soon as we put robots out on the street, we learned some really interesting problems, like how should robots cross the road? Or how should robots interact with people with visual or mobility impairments? We quickly realized that we need to teach our robots how to communicate with people. People on the sidewalk come from every walk of life, so we needed to create a new language, kind of a universal language. So people and robots can understand each other right off the bat. Because no one's going to be reading user manuals. We started with eyes. Because eyes are universal. They can show where the robot is going or if it's confused. Plus eyes make robots more human. We also used sounds. For example, we created this running sound with frequent gaps so that people with visual impairments could locate their robots using the Doppler effect. But it turned out these were not enough. At intersections, cars with cutting-front-of-a-robots drivers were getting confused sometimes because robots would take too long before they started crossing. Even ordinary pedestrians were getting confused. Sometimes they couldn't figure out on which side to pass the robots because robots make a lot of small adjustments to their direction as they move. This actually sparked a new idea. What if we used movement to create a universal language? Like at intersections, robots would gently move forward before they start crossing to signal to drivers that it's their turn. If they see someone on a wheelchair, they yield by pointing themselves away from the sidewalk to signal that they're not going to move. Some of you may remember this. In 2015, Canadian researchers sent a robot hitchhiking across the US. It didn't get very far. It turns out that robots can also use some social skills. If they're being tampered with, Carnegie Mellon researchers have shown that small toy robots should play dead because people feel bad when they think they broke it. But delivery robots aren't toys. They're not small. They're up there in public. We found that we deliver robots to get people to stop tampering. Robots need to show awareness. It's kind of the opposite of playing dead. In this case, robots need to acknowledge the situation to get people to step away. Also word of advice. If you're a robot and you see small kids run towards the closest adult, it turns out that some kids just love harassing robots. So besides dystopia, Hollywood also promised us some really cool robots that would run our errands or keep us company. So far, we've really focused on food delivery. But in the future, these robots can do more. Like they could gather excess food and bring it to shelters every night. Because in America, we've raised 30% of our food while 10% of our people experience food insecurity. These robots could be part of the solution. Or when we have hundreds of robots running around cities, we could have robots carrying emergency medications at all times, just in case someone nearby has an allergic reaction or an asthma attack. These robots could be on site within a minute or two faster than anyone else. And during pandemics, robots can be a key part of our infrastructure. They can ensure that we can provide our communities with their essential needs even during emergencies. Let me leave you with one last thought. Today, objects can't get from A to B without human health. Because our three-dimensional world is quite complex. But new sensors and AI can change that. In a way, technology is like a baby that has just learned to recognize objects and understand words and maybe even hold a basic conversation, but it hasn't learned to walk yet. Now, we are teaching technology how to navigate the three-dimensional world without our help. We are entering this new era where insentient objects are going to get up and move freely. And when they do, we're going to make sure they don't look like aliens. My vision for the future is that when things come to life, they do so with joy. You know, less like the movie Terminator and more like Toy Story. Thank you.","We've been creating small, self-driving robots that navigate quiet alleys and sidewalk on a watching pace and have a secured cargo to deliver your food and supplies.

So are you guys going to mute when I talk so nothing interrupts it? Yes. Because once I'm in the floor, once I'm in the floor I like to stay in the floor. Having some type of support is very necessary when you're creative. You know, there has to be something that's fueling that creativity, that's fueling that fight that you have inside. My love for music and creativity starts way back, way back. Back in the South Bronx where I grew up, built in 700 apartment two E. I will go outside and all I would hear is music. You go around to the back park, the DJs are playing, it's a basketball game going on, but then you would look at the handball court. And that handball court have an amazing graffiti mirror. I don't know if it's from Keith Harren or Fab5 Freddie. I was instantly attracted to the creative. Music has been my therapy since day one. Anytime I get stressed out, I go to the arts, I go to creativity, I go to music. Music makes people feel hugged, people feel loved. And then I remember one of my uncles saying you should get into producing, what's producing? You know, it started as a family owned business because rough riders was created by my family. It gave you DMX, it gave you EVE, it gave you drag on, it gave you the locks. I've gotten every accolade in music that one can get. It just came to the point where it's like, you know what? I'm no longer going to have fun with this unless I'm able to give back. You know, the Dean Collection started for me to create a museum for my family and our name. Something that my kids would have to be responsible to pass the generations. I said, wait a minute, the Dean Collection is not just for the Dean Collection. The Dean Collection is for everyone. There's some galleries now in places you walk in. If you don't have 50,000, there's nothing to talk about. And I felt that a lot of people was using that as an excuse to exit art. They feel that art is only for rich people. Whoa, we gotta stop this, we gotta fix this. And that's what made me and my wife say, you know, we have to create an entry point to the younger generation that didn't understand the art world, didn't have that seat at the table. And then we started, no commissions. It's a big event. You got 30 something thousand RSVPs a night. The drinks are free, the food is free, the concert's free. The education is free. And I feel that education should be free. We went to Shanghai, we went to London, we went to Berlin. We did it right in my backyard in the South Bronx. You can come into no commissions and get something for a couple of bucks or a couple of hundred thousand. There's a tear for every person that have love for art. And what we're doing is something totally different from a gallery. The artists keep 100% of the sales. But what about after no commissions? How can you sustain? How can you move forward without having to be trapped to sell your soul? I was a part of the sale with my brother, Sean Diddy Combs, the $21 million purchase which may carry James Marshue, the highest selling African American living artists to today. I'm like, man, you just broke the record and the artist was like, yeah, I don't know whether to be happy or to be sad. He first sold that work. It was under 100,000. So imagine a work that you made for under 100,000 is now being sold for 21 million. And you have to sit home and watch this. And you couldn't even participate 5%. When you look at it, I'm a producer, I'm a songwriter. Every time it's played on the radio, I get paid. Every time it's played on a movie, I get paid. Every time it plays period, I get paid. Visual artists, they only get paid once. How? When paintings are sold and traded multiple times. And that's that artist's lifetime work that other people are making 10, 15, sometimes, 100 times more than the artists that created it. So I created something called the Dean's Choice Wear. If you're a seller or a collector and you bring in your work until let's say Sotheby's, there's a paper that's there that say, hey guys, you know, this artist is still living. You've made 300% on your investment by working with this artist. You can choose to give the artist whatever you want of the sale. I think that even if five people did it, it'll start to change everything in the arts. And this has happened in Europe already. It happens in the music industry. It's called Publishing. And artists are able to survive. Musicians are able to survive years after years. Offer the residual income of their publishing. So how can we take something that brings creatives together and celebrate each other? Myself and Timberland been working on this idea called Versus for about three years now. Then this try and time came and everybody started going to social media to express themselves. So what we did was I played my top songs. He played his top songs. And we went on Instagram live. You have fun? This is so good for the culture. Let's go. A lot of people like to say battle. We pulled back off of that word battle because we're battling enough in the world today. We call it an educational celebration. I think we on our ninth or tenth one, me and Timberland started out with 20,000 people as of yesterday, 750,000 people in one room. So we have this thing called the Versus Effect. And the Versus Effect is what happened to the artists after they contribute to Versus. We can go to the baby face in Teddy Rally. They both went up millions of views. Both of their songs re-entered the charts. And then we look at the first ladies versus. And both Eric and I do and Jill Scott have seven positions in the top 20 charts. This is the Versus Effect. You know, billions and billions and billions of impressions. This is something I've never seen before. And I felt that these artists are getting their flowers today, which is a great thing. Why they could smell them? This is personal for me because many a times I've been counted out. I've been hot and cold a hundred times. You still have to understand the business as an artist to elevate to your level that you deserve to be. Because most creative, we're very emotional. We're very, let somebody else handle that. I want to stick to this. But not only creativity is key. Education is key, which is the reason why I went back to school to shop in my pencil and my mid-30s. We have to know our business. But it's going to take us digging in a little deeper and pulling out the knowledge that we need to prepare ourselves for this world as waiting to take advantage of the creatives. When we can make better choices, then we can end that conversation of artists dying poor. If we're not protecting the arts, we're not protecting our future, we're not protecting this world. Creativity heals us. Because these shades close and fall. Time out. I kind of like that. That's cool.",How can we take something that brings creatives together and celebrate each other?

Almost exactly ten years ago, I was sitting in an exam room that was way too cold, waiting to meet my new oncologist. I was terrified. Even though my partner at the time was sitting right by my side, I felt completely alone. I had just been diagnosed with breast cancer. And it seemed at the time that a single bright spot on a scan of my right lung meant that the cancer had already spread. I had metastatic breast cancer. I had no medical training at this point, but I knew what it meant if it were true. Incurable breast cancer. Terminal breast cancer. I was 27 years old, had just been accepted to medical school, and I wondered if I was already at the end of my life. My new oncologist was not a warm person. She dealt in simple facts as many brilliant physicians do. Our body is made up of cells. She started. I stopped her. I'm starting medical school soon. I know instead of taking this as a signal to go backward to start again, she went forward. She said that I would need to start on chemotherapy to control the cancer. She launched into the details of the drug and the side effects and the schedule. I reminded her that we hadn't even yet biopsy the bright spot on my lung, and I asked if she was sure that it was cancer. I remember viscerally how she seemed almost frustrated with my question. Perhaps she thought I wasn't following along with her explanations, or were still, I was in denial. I simply wanted her to understand that as her patient, the biopsy was not just a mere formality to prove an already foregone conclusion. It was a steel needle through skin, muscle, and bone that would deliver a deep piece of me to the surface. An answer, a question I wish didn't have to be asked. Before the biopsy, I could be a 27-year-old woman who might have metastatic breast cancer, who probably had metastatic breast cancer. This is a critical distinction, but it's not one that's emphasized in the most elite oncology training. Instead, I was dismissed with an appointment to start treatment in just a few weeks. So much has happened since that first visit. Ironically, the biopsy was not just a mere formality. My former oncologist was right. It did show cancer, but it was a totally separate lung cancer. And as crazy as it sounds, this was great news. I did not have metastatic breast cancer. I had two different cancers, but both of them were localized. And so the lung cancer was localized enough that it could be removed. And so the onslaught of treatments began, with a long surgery, continued with chemotherapy, and ended with a breast surgery just after my 28th birthday. And then two weeks later, I started medical school. My new oncologist, who deals much more fluidly both with facts and their implications, very reasonably suggested that I should defer my acceptance to medical school for a year. Take some time to rest, to recover, and I trusted her advice. I felt terrible during the intensive chemotherapy sessions. And so I wrote to the dean, I explained my circumstances, and a deferral was speedily granted. But as the chemo fog lifted, I wondered what I was going to do with a year. Should I go to the beach? I wasn't really a beach person. And how many years did I have left anyway? I really wanted to go to medical school. It seems like a missing piece of my puzzle. So instead of going around and around within decision, I asked myself, what's the worst that could happen? Well, I could be too weak or too sick to do the work. It could be too hard for me emotionally. I could fail out of medical school. But then I remembered that wouldn't be the worst thing that happened to me even that year. So why not get started? Why not continue living the way that I wanted to live? So I did. Bald and real thin. I put on my best earrings and my favorite dress. And I started. I pretended to belong and I began to. There is no way to describe how hard it was. Some days it felt impossible. It felt as if I was doing things that would never matter in the future. But every day I asked myself, are you still enjoying this? Is this still what you want to be doing? And every day the answer was yes. Sometimes a very qualified yes, but a yes. And then just as I was getting comfortable and feeling like I might not necessarily fail out of medical school, I received even more devastating news. I learned that I had a mutation in a gene called TP53 or P53 for short. Known as the guardian of the genome, a mutation, P53 is responsible for supervising the repair of our DNA. A mutation in this gene means errors go uncorrected. It means that normal cells become cancerous at a much higher rate. All of a sudden with this knowledge, my medical history made a terrible kind of sense. I had had a childhood cancer, Rabdo, myocercoma, at age seven. It occurred when I was a teenager. And this was all before P53 had been discovered in the lab. Then I'd had young adult breast and lung cancers. With the knowledge of this mutation, it seemed that there was likely no end to the number of cancers that I could expect in my future. And yet, I decided to become a radiation oncologist. I hope to graduate from residency in just a few months, move to a new city and start my first real job as a doctor and researcher. Because of grit, because of privilege, because of therapy, because of my medical teams and my family and my teachers. Because genetic diagnoses should give us the knowledge to move forward. And even in the year 2020, that generally doesn't mean miracle cures or medical breakthroughs. Having a devastating genetic diagnosis means learning to live with uncertainty. It means learning that you and your diagnosis are not the worst thing that could happen. Learning to live with uncertainty means walking forward into a life that is as full of beauty as it is of challenges. It means learning for yourself that cancer is just part of your story. It may not be the worst thing that happens to you. If it is, that's okay. You can claim that and you can own that. But let that be a narrative that you author and you authorize. Not one that's prescribed to you by someone else. Have your deferral letter in hand, but use it on your terms. As I come to the end of my oncology training, I have Deja Vu again and again with the following scenario. A patient has cancer. There are several options, all of which offer a different balance between cure and quality of life, between the possibility of alleviating suffering and the possibility of causing suffering. And oncologist lays out the options, but somewhere in the discussion, things get skewed. The choice becomes something more like, well, you could choose to do something. Or you could choose to do nothing. We could be aggressive and treat your cancer. Or we could watch it at 9.9 times out of 10. The patient says, I want to do everything I can do. Of course, who wouldn't want everything? But what is everything? Is everything the ability to sit in your own home in front of your window bathed in sunshine and surrounded by family? Is everything still being able to feel your fingers and your toes because they haven't gone numb from chemotherapy? As oncologists, our everything is cancer treatment. It's radiation and surgery and chemotherapy and novel treatments. And for us, the worst thing that could happen, and I have heard more than one oncologist say this, the worst thing that could happen is that the patient will develop metastatic disease. Or the worst thing that could happen is that five years from now, the cancer will grow and I'll have to give more radiation. As a patient and as an oncologist, I would never argue that these are not devastating outcomes. But are they the worst? Should cancer control be at the center of our thinking? Always. Many, unspeakably, unfathomably painful and brutal things have happened to me because of my cancers and my genetic mutation. And yet, I consider myself very lucky indeed because the worst thing that could happen never came to pass. Because I have let devastation and uncertainty sit at the table, but somewhere off to the side. When I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, I went to Boston for a second opinion because what could I lose? When my oncologists give me very good and very safe and very standard advice, I started medical school anyway, even though I was undergoing active cancer treatment. Instead of shying away from patients with cancer, I became a radiation oncologist and I work with patients who are very much like me every single day. Instead of imagining the suffering that I might cause to a future partner, when I died of cancer, I married my wonderful husband. Because the worst thing that can happen is always a series of negatives. It's blank spaces that should be filled with life. So what is the most that I have leaned into this kind of radical uncertainty? Well, this is William. He is the most joyful person that I have ever met. And in just over a year, he has already made the world a better place. As oncologists, we talk to our patients as if the worst thing that could happen is that their cancer could come back or that it could spread or that they could die from it. As a patient, I know that these are paramount, but I want to change the way that we think about this. And I want to change the way that we talk about this with our patients. As a patient, the worst thing that can happen is that cancer robs you of opportunity, of the ability to be and to do and to love. And it will, at least temporarily, it will. But to minimize this loss of life in the living, that is the harder. And I would say true or job of the oncologist. To take all the tools that we have and situate them in the context of a patient's whole entire life. To be guides for how to sit with suffering, acknowledge it deeply. But to not let fear a future suffering be the narrative for the journey forward. One of my mentors always says the medicine part is easy. And it never feels that way to a junior doctor. But it's contours our finite. We have big studies to guide us and it's what we learn to do in residency. Much harder is learning how to help each patient navigate the multitudes contained in their illness. So I find it really funny that in retrospect, my life looks like a neat package. It looks as if I planned each successive step. And that perhaps cancer has led to the good things in my life. Step one, apply to medical school. Step two, get diagnosed with and treated for cancer. And step three, have it all, a career and family. But I will tell you that each phase was a leap of faith. Despite an almost paralyzing uncertainty. And so it's that courage that I try to give to each of my patients. I try to do this regardless of the technical, medical details of cancers and treatment decisions and mutations. Regardless of the slippery fiction of prognosis. I try to learn what they want and what they need, what they wish and what they worry, what they dream about, what animated them before and what will sustain them during the beastly process of cancer treatment. It doesn't actually take that much time. It does take a few focused, quiet moments that require intentional cultivation. But this is partnership. And it matters. Because the worst thing that can happen is to have an oncologist who does everything. Everything to help cure your cancer. And who does nothing to help you live your life. Thank you.","Almost exactly exactly ten years ago, I was sitting in an exam room that was way too cold, waiting to meet my new oncologist. I was terrified. Even though my partner at the time was sitting right by my side, I felt completely alone. I had just been diagnosed with breast cancer.",https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_lupack_the_race_to_decode_a_mysterious_language?language=en
